# hello-world
just starting out teaching myself programming

I am an aspiring praogrammer. Still unsure of what avenue I would like to delve into, so I am learning a bit of different basic coding languages. I am self teaching myself because I do not have the finances to go back to school for a CS degree. I currently work in the medical field and would like to find some financially stable and fun career that melds computer prgamming and medicine.

Perhaps I may want to design an educational website 

Or maybe work on EMR

I am unsure. I will report when I have more figured out.
